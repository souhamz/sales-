### Business problem:

Predicting future sales

### Data:
The developed sales prediction model utilizes a machine learning algorithm, such as a time series forecasting technique or regression analysis, to predict future sales based on historical data and relevant features. (e.g. # obs)


## Methods
Evaluation Metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual sales values.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Provides a measure of the standard deviation of the prediction errors.
R-squared (R2) Score: Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (sales) that is predictable from the independent variables.
For example, after training the model on historical data, we achieved an MAE of X, RMSE of Y, and R2 score of Z, indicating that the model accurately predicts sales with minimal error.

## Model

Here, we see the best results as far as the regression metrics and the model's performance.
This model still has some bias. However, this model has the best performance on the testing set.
